# A simple Odin program with a minimal rectangle example using WASM and JS.

- use `watcher/watcher MODIFY build.sh` while developing to run the build script each time you save the main.odin file, for ease of use.
- use `npm install -g http-server` and `http-server` to run a server.

open `localhost:8080` in your browser to see the rectangle
